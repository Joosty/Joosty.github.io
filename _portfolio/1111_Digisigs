**Module Title**: Digital Signal Acquisition and Processing (EMS707U) | **Location**: London, UK | **Dates**: Jan 2025 - May 2025

This coursework project demonstrates practical implementation of data acquisition systems and advanced digital signal processing techniques. Through hands-on laboratory work with multiple sensor types, the project explores real-world signal conditioning, filtering, and analysis methodologies essential for modern engineering applications.

### Project Overview:

- **Multi-Sensor Data Acquisition**: The study integrates three distinct sensor systems: Q-Arena optical tracking for motion validation, Force Sensing Resistors (FSR) for weight measurement, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) for vibration analysis across various frequency and amplitude combinations.

- **Signal Processing Pipeline**: Implementation of comprehensive DSP techniques including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, frequency domain characterization, and digital filter design using second-order Butterworth IIR bandpass filters to optimize signal-to-noise ratios.

- **MATLAB Integration**: Development of custom MATLAB scripts for real-time data collection, Arduino interface programming, and post-processing analysis with automated visualization and quantitative assessment tools.

### Technical Implementation:

**Data Acquisition Systems:**
- Q-Arena tracking system with three-marker configuration for motion validation
- Arduino-based FSR circuit with voltage-to-force conversion algorithms
- LSM9DS1 IMU integration with I2C communication protocols

**Signal Processing Techniques:**
- Time domain analysis with statistical characterization (mean, standard deviation, range)
- FFT implementation with Hann windowing to minimize spectral leakage
- Frequency domain analysis including dominant frequency identification and phase extraction
- Digital filter design with bandpass configuration (0.10-0.47 Hz) for noise reduction

**Performance Validation:**
- Achieved 3.78 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio through filtering
- 38.13% noise variance reduction with 90% energy preservation in passband
- Cross-validation between optical tracking and bending sensor measurements
