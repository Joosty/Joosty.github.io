                        <h4>BEXUS 37 - Project SOBER Payload & Mechanical Co-Lead</h4>
                        <p class="cv-meta">REXUS/BEXUS Programme | September 2024 – December 2025 (1 year 4 months)</p>
                        <p>As the Payload and Mechanical Engineering Co-Lead, I oversaw a team of five members to complete the mechanical design of a stratospheric balloon payload. This involved not only technical work but also rigorous systems engineering documentation, regular design reviews, and interactions with our industry stakeholders. The programme is supported by experts from ESA, DLR, SSC, Rymdstyrelsen, ZARM and EuroLaunch. <strong>BEXUS 37 launched successfully in October 2025 from Esrange Space Center in north Sweden with the longest flight time ever recorded as part of the BEXUS programme.</strong></p>
